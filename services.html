						<p>We believe our role is to be the link between the manufacturer and the end consumer/user of the product. Our ability to synergies these two aspects has helped us sustain ourselves in the market. Quality plays an extremely important role in this scenario. We have an extremely robust filtration process for vendor management, continuous in-process and final inspection by an independent reliable third party inspection agency. We make sure that the packing, labelling, transportation of the products are in accordance with the specifications of the customer. Emphasis on hygiene and systematic storage of products are key to providing quality and timely delivery of goods. We further provide options of sterilising the products to meet different microbiological parameters. </p>
                            
                            <p>By working in close partnership with our vendors we are able to have full tracking and traceability of the raw material. We have developed and adhere strictly to the standard operating procedures for quality management in our company. </p>
